      <h2>💬 Honest Review</h2>
      <p>
        The Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 6 is the most refined foldable phone yet — thinner, lighter, and smarter. 
        Samsung has truly listened to user feedback, making the phone more practical without losing the “wow” factor 
        that makes foldables special.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main 7.6-inch screen feels massive, perfect for multitasking, watching movies, or editing documents. 
        The 120Hz refresh rate and improved brightness make everything look sharp and fluid. 
        The outer display is now wider, making it easier to type and use single-handedly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Performance-wise, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip ensures everything flies — from gaming to photo editing. 
        The optimized cooling system helps keep temperatures low even under heavy loads. 
        Paired with Samsung’s One UI, the Fold 6 feels smoother than ever.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cameras deliver solid results across lighting conditions. 
        The 50MP main sensor produces crisp, balanced shots, and the telephoto lens captures impressive zoom details. 
        It might not beat the Galaxy S25 Ultra, but it’s more than capable for most users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Battery life lasts a full day of normal use, though intensive multitasking may need an evening top-up. 
        The hinge feels durable and more dust-resistant, showing Samsung’s steady improvement in build quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, the Galaxy Z Fold 6 offers a futuristic yet dependable experience. 
        It’s perfect for productivity lovers and tech enthusiasts who want more than just another smartphone — 
        it’s a device that blends power, innovation, and flexibility.
