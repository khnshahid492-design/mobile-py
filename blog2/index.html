      <h2>💬 Honest Review</h2>
      <p>
        After using the iPhone 16 Pro for a week, I can say it’s one of the smoothest phones I’ve tried. 
        The screen looks sharp, the scrolling feels fast, and the overall performance stays stable even with heavy apps running.
      </p>
      <p>
        The camera captures clear photos with good natural colors. Night mode is improved — less grainy shots and more detail in dark areas. 
        The new processor also helps when editing photos or videos directly on the phone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The battery easily lasts a full day for normal use like calls, browsing, and social media. 
        Charging speed is decent but not the fastest compared to Android phones. 
        However, it feels very optimized — you rarely worry about lag or heat.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, the iPhone 16 Pro focuses on a smooth experience more than flashy features. 
        It’s reliable, stylish, and ideal for users who want a premium phone that “just works”.
